# covid-map-project

## Goal of this project:
- Center the map on the user's current location with a zoom level that allows to see a few kilometers/miles around that location
- Use the provided file `testing-centers.json` to get the coordinates of the COVID-19 testing centers. This file is using the GEOJSON format to store geo data.
- Display those testing locations with markers on the map
- Then display a circle with a 1 kilometer radius around each testing center
- Use the samples from https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/examples to help you implement those features
